# Card_validator
Simple project that uses Luhn’s algorithm to validate a user's credit card. 
The program works for all popular cards like Visa, Amex, MasterCard, etc. 
Luhn’s algorithm checks for basic validations; for example, a Visa card should start with 4 and then moves on to complex digit-wise calculations.
